# Decision-Models-and-Analytics-Projects
Used programs in Excel to solve important optimization and simulation business problems.

Used Simplex Solver to solve linear programming optimization models & GRG Nonlinear or Evolutionary Solver to solve non-linear optimization models.

Introduced Crystal Ball for simulation modeling. Simulation models for normal, log-normal, bernoulli etc. distributions. Included constraints and optimization for certain variables, i.e. simulating profit distribution while minimizing costs under demand uncertainty.
